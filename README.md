[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

**A 28-Day Journey to Build a Production-Ready DevOps Portfolio**
Combining **full-stack development** with **professional DevOps practices** — from frontend UI to CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and monitoring.

---

## 📌 Project Vision
To create a **public, recruiter-ready portfolio** that demonstrates:
- Modern React/Next.js frontend development
- Professional DevOps workflows and tooling
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Multi-environment cloud deployment
- Monitoring and observability integration

---

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### ✅ Completed (Days 3/28)
- **Development Environment**: WSL Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, Node.js v22.18.0
- **Version Control**: Dual GitHub account workflow, branch protection rules
- **Frontend Setup**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **First UI Component**: Interactive DevOps Skills Showcase (click-to-expand skill cards with ratings)
- **Multi-Page Structure**: Implemented file-based routing for Home, About, Projects, and Contact pages
- **Navigation Component**: Reusable `<Navigation />` with active link styling via `usePathname()`
- **Hero Section**: Added branding text and responsive layout to Home page


### 🎯 Upcoming
- Multi-page portfolio structure with Next.js routing
- Navigation and hero sections
- Backend API with Node.js/Express
- Dockerized local development
- Terraform AWS infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated So Far
- **Frontend**: React functional components, props, state, events, Tailwind styling
- **Next.js**: Client vs server components, hot reload, TypeScript integration, file-based routing, dynamic active states
- **Accessibility**: `aria-current` usage, keyboard focus outlines in navigation
- **DevOps**: Git workflows, branch protection, repository security
- **Problem-Solving**: Fixed active link not updating (missing `"use client"`), resolved 404 from incorrect folder structure
