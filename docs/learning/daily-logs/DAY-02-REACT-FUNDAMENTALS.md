### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: useState hook
- **Event Handling**: `onClick` interactions for expand/collapse
- **Responsive Design**: Flexbox & grid layout

### 🧠 Key Learnings

#### React Component Thinking
- Components are **reusable building blocks**
- Same structure, different data = scalable UI
- Props for input data, state for dynamic changes

#### Next.js Client vs Server Components
- `"use client"` directive required for hooks like `useState`
- Server components can’t manage client-side state

#### Problem-Solving Wins
1. **Caching Issue** → Solved via hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)  
2. **Hook Error** → Fixed by moving to a client component  
3. **Concept Overload** → Resolved by focusing step-by-step

---

### 🤔 Challenges Faced

1. **Browser Caching**
   - **Solution**: Hard refresh
   - **Learning**: Development caching can mask updates

2. **useState Hook Error**
   - **Solution**: `"use client"` directive at top of file
   - **Learning**: Difference between server/client components

3. **Too Many New Concepts**
   - **Solution**: Slowed down, tackled concepts in order
   - **Learning**: Understanding before coding saves time

---

### 🎯 Tomorrow's Goals
- Implement Next.js file-based routing
- Create professional navigation component
- Build hero section with personal branding
- Prepare for multi-page portfolio structure

---

### 📊 Metrics
- **Components built**: 1 (reusable SkillCard)
- **UI interactions added**: Expand/collapse, star ratings
- **Concepts mastered**: Props, state, events, conditional rendering
- **Time efficiency**: Completed planned goals in allotted time

## 🔗 Useful Snippets from Today

### SkillCard Component

"use client";
import { useState } from "react";

function SkillCard({ name, rating }: { name: string; rating: number }) {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);
  const stars = '⭐'.repeat(rating);

  return (
    <div 
      className="cursor-pointer hover:shadow-lg p-4 border rounded-md"
      onClick={() => setIsExpanded(!isExpanded)}
    >
      <h3 className="font-bold">{name}</h3>
      <div>{stars}</div>
      <span>{rating}/10</span>
      {isExpanded && <div>Detailed skills...</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
